# Exercise for Data Scientist Position
This is an exercise made for the interview process of the Data Scientist position in the RoadMotion team of ClearMotion,Inc.



## Description

Multiple drive sessions have been collected while driving different vehicles in a section of the I-93 interstate highway in Massachusetts.  The data can be found in the attached folder and are given in Excel format. Each file contains data for each drive session recorded with a different vehicle in different time. The session ID is a 5-digit number reported within each file name. After parsing the data in MATLAB, R, or Python, based on your preference, please address the following questions:

a)	What is the mean and standard deviation of the vehicle speed for each drive session?

b)	Which are the three sessions with the highest mean value of vehicle speed? How you can make sure that your answer is correct? 

c)	You want to understand whether drivers have any driving patterns in terms of vehicle speed along this I-93 road path. Are there any patterns in vehicle speed along this road? If so, for which segments of road? (Use GPS coordinates as a means for localization along the road path). Please use graphs to demonstrate your results and support your conclusion in a comprehensive manner.  


## Useful Information about .csv files:


|Variable Name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| time_offset  | Recorded time [sec]  |
| speed  | Vehicle speed [m/sec] |
| latitude | GPS latitude coordinate |
| longitude | GPS longitude coordinate |



## Instruction

Please write your answers for a, b, and c in a Jupyter notebook or Word document.
